# Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

In day-to-day computer use, data exists in different states, namely at rest and in transit. When data is at rest, it is stored in non-volatile storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives, or other persistent storage mediums. Examples of data at rest include files saved on your computer's hard drive, documents stored in cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox, and archived emails in your mailbox. On the other hand, data in transit refers to information that is actively moving between devices or networks. This occurs when you send an email, download a file from the internet, or stream a video. Encryption protocols, such as HTTPS for web browsing or VPNs for secure network connections, play a crucial role in safeguarding data during transit by encrypting the information to protect it from unauthorized access. Understanding the distinction between data at rest and in transit is essential for implementing effective security measures to protect sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

Data encryption plays a pivotal role in upholding the principles of the CIA triad, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Firstly, in terms of confidentiality, encryption ensures that sensitive information remains private and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. By converting plaintext data into ciphertext through complex algorithms, encryption shields the content from prying eyes. Secondly, encryption contributes to maintaining the integrity of data. It ensures that information remains unaltered during storage or transmission. Any unauthorized modification to the encrypted data would result in decryption failure, alerting users to potential tampering. Finally, in the context of availability, encryption contributes indirectly by fostering trust in the secure exchange of information. Users can confidently share and access encrypted data, knowing that the confidentiality and integrity of the information are preserved. In summary, data encryption is a cornerstone in fortifying the CIA triad, safeguarding information by preserving its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

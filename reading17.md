## Why is this topic important

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is for organizing and isolating cloud resources, while a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is for establishing secure communication over the internet. VPC structures cloud environments, while VPN encrypts and secures data transmission between networks or devices.


1. What are some of the key features of the VPC model?

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) model provides network isolation, subnet creation, customizable IP addressing, security groups, and route tables for managing resources in cloud environments.

2. What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?

    1. Presentation Tier (Client Tier): This tier is responsible for presenting the user interface and processing user inputs.

    2. Application Tier (Logic Tier): This tier contains the business logic and application processing. It handles tasks such as data validation, processing, and the overall application logic.

    3. Data Tier (Storage Tier): This tier manages the storage and retrieval of data. It stores and retrieves data from databases or other data storage systems.

3. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.


A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a cloud-based network infrastructure that organizes and isolates resources within a cloud provider's environment, allowing for the creation of virtual networks. In contrast, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) establishes secure and encrypted connections over the internet, primarily used for secure communication between remote locations and a private network. While a VPC focuses on cloud resource organization, a VPN is geared towards ensuring secure data transmission over public networks, serving purposes like remote access or connecting distributed networks.

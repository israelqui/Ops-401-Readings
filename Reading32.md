# Malware Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
## Why is this topic important?

Traffic analysis with Wireshark is crucial for maintaining network security, troubleshooting connectivity issues, investigating security incidents, and enforcing compliance policies. By capturing and analyzing network traffic, security professionals can detect and respond to security threats such as malware infections, unauthorized access attempts, and data exfiltration. Wireshark also serves as a valuable tool for diagnosing network performance issues, identifying the root causes of latency, packet loss, and other network-related problems. Furthermore, Wireshark aids in forensic investigations by providing evidence of malicious activities and unauthorized access. It is also an essential tool for enforcing security policies and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Overall, Wireshark plays a pivotal role in network monitoring, analysis, and security, making it indispensable for organizations and individuals in the field of cybersecurity and networking.

1. You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.

    My main responsibility is to analyze and understand malicious software, or malware, that may be targeting computer systems, networks, or devices.

    I spend a lot of time examining different types of malware such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware to figure out how they work, what they do, and how they can be detected and removed.

    My job involves dissecting malware samples in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, to understand their behavior and functionality without risking harm to real systems. I use various tools and techniques to analyze the code, including reverse engineering, debugging, and disassembly.

    Once I understand how a particular malware operates, I document my findings and develop strategies to detect, prevent, and mitigate its impact. This could involve creating signatures for antivirus software, developing intrusion detection rules, or providing recommendations for system administrators to secure their networks.

    Overall, my goal as a Malware Analyst is to protect computer systems and networks from the harmful effects of malware by understanding how it works and developing effective countermeasures to combat it.


2. What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?

    1. Acquisition: Obtaining the malware sample in a safe and controlled manner.
    2. Identification: Determining the type and characteristics of the malware.
    3. Behavioral Analysis: Observing the malware's actions and behaviors in a controlled environment.
    4. Static Analysis: Examining the code and structure of the malware without executing it.
    5. Dynamic Analysis: Executing the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real-time.
    6. Reporting: Documenting findings, including indicators of compromise (IOCs) and recommendations for mitigation.

3. You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?

    When tasked with analyzing a new malware sample, the first type of malware analysis I would conduct is Static Analysis.

    Static analysis involves examining the code and structure of the malware without executing it. This initial step allows me to gather valuable information about the malware's characteristics, such as its file format, functions, API calls, and potential indicators of malicious behavior.

    Static analysis provides insights into the malware's potential capabilities, vulnerabilities, and obfuscation techniques without the risk of activating its harmful payload. It also helps in identifying specific features that can guide further analysis, such as identifying hardcoded IP addresses, domains, or encryption keys.

    By conducting static analysis first, I can gain a foundational understanding of the malware's inner workings, which informs subsequent steps in the analysis process, such as dynamic analysis to observe its behavior in a controlled environment or developing signatures for detection and mitigation.

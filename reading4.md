# Systems Hardening with CIS Standards
## Why is this topic important

Learning about system hardening with CIS standards is crucial as it provides a systematic and proven approach to fortify our systems against cyber threats. Implementing these standards involves configuring systems according to industry-accepted best practices, reducing vulnerabilities, and minimizing the attack surface. By hardening systems using CIS benchmarks, we proactively strengthen our defenses, mitigating potential risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromises. This not only bolsters our overall security posture but also aligns us with recognized industry standards, enhancing our ability to meet compliance requirements and ensuring a more resilient infrastructure against evolving threats.

1. What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?

1. Enhanced Security: CIS Benchmarks provide comprehensive, industry-accepted best practices for securing systems and networks. They offer specific guidelines and configurations to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate common threats. By adhering to these benchmarks, organizations can strengthen their overall security posture, minimizing the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

2. Regulatory Compliance: Many regulatory standards and frameworks reference CIS Benchmarks as a recommended or required set of security practices. Following these benchmarks can aid in meeting compliance requirements such as those outlined in GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and others. Compliance not only reduces the risk of penalties but also ensures that systems and data are managed according to established industry standards.

3. Consistency and Standardization: CIS Benchmarks promote uniformity in security configurations across different systems and platforms. They provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for configuring various technologies, enabling organizations to maintain consistency in security measures across their infrastructure. This standardization simplifies management, troubleshooting, and auditing processes, leading to more efficient and effective security practices.

2. What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?

1. Operating Systems: This category includes guidelines and best practices for securing various operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, and others. It covers settings related to user authentication, access controls, network configurations, and more.

2. Cloud Computing: As cloud services become prevalent, CIS provides benchmarks for securing cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others. It includes recommendations for identity and access management, storage security, network settings, and data protection in the cloud environment.

3. Network Devices: This category focuses on securing network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. It includes configurations related to access controls, network segmentation, encryption, logging, and other network-specific security measures.

4. Databases: CIS Benchmarks offer guidelines for securing databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others. This covers configurations for access controls, encryption, patch management, auditing, and other database security best practices.

5. Containers: With the rise of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, CIS provides benchmarks to secure container environments. This includes recommendations for container image security, orchestration security, network isolation, and more.

6. Mobile Devices: This category covers securing mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It includes recommendations for securing operating systems (iOS, Android), managing device settings, implementing encryption, and securing mobile applications.

7. Web Browsers: CIS Benchmarks offer guidance for securing web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc. This includes configurations related to privacy settings, secure browsing practices, plug-in management, and other browser-specific security measures.

3. How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?

Implementing CIS Benchmarks is pivotal for our organization's compliance strategy. These benchmarks are widely recognized as industry-standard best practices for cybersecurity, aligning seamlessly with numerous regulatory bodies and compliance frameworks. Their comprehensive guidance offers a clear roadmap for securing diverse technologies, ensuring a standardized approach across our IT infrastructure. By adhering to these benchmarks, we not only mitigate risks and bolster our security posture but also streamline our compliance efforts, potentially saving significant costs and resources associated with non-compliance. Their adaptability to evolving threats and consistent updates make them a proactive investment toward maintaining compliance in an ever-changing security landscape.

## Analogy

Implementing CIS Benchmarks is like to following a well-detailed recipe while cooking a complex dish. Just as a recipe provides step-by-step instructions and recommended ingredients for a successful culinary outcome, CIS Benchmarks offer comprehensive guidance and industry-accepted best practices for securing various technologies. Similar to how following a recipe ensures consistency and quality in the final dish, adhering to CIS Benchmarks establishes a standardized, secure configuration across our IT infrastructure, enhancing our overall cybersecurity posture.
